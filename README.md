## Hi there 👋

I am a Physics student at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) focused on data science, artificial intelligence and Cosmology. I am currently conducting undergraduate research at Fiocruz PE, integrating data for public health research. I have experience in machine learning, data engineering, and cloud computing. I share my cosmology and data analysis projects here.
