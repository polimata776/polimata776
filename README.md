## Hi there 👋

Graduate in physics at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Specialist in People and Data at CITi UFPE, a junior technology company at the UFPE’s Computer Center, where I integrate People Analytics, data visualization and organizational culture to support more human strategic decisions.

Currently I study data engineering at O Boticário and also carry out personal projects in the area of data and artificial intelligence. In addition, I study Leadership in the Aspire Leaders Program. I am strongly interested in data area, artificial intelligence, observational cosmology, quantum physics, as well as exploring interdisciplinary areas such as neurodivergences, decolonial astronomy and the trajectories of black and indigenous women in the sciences. I believe that the encounter between these fields strengthens a more critical, inclusive and transformative science.

I have knowledge in languages such as Python, SQL, C, C++, C#, Java and PHP, besides the use of tools like Excel, Looker Studio, Google Sheets among others. My motivation is to combine technique, creativity and diversity to build solutions that make a difference in the world.
