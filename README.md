## Hi there 👋

I am Brenda Alves, a graduating student in Physics Education at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). I serve as a People & Data Specialist at CITi UFPE, the junior enterprise of UFPE's Center for Informatics (CIn), where I integrate People Analytics, data visualization, and organizational culture to support more human-centric, evidence-based strategic decisions.

In pursuit of continuous learning, I am currently studying Cloud Computing at CESAR. I have completed the Aspire Leaders Program from the Aspire Institute and the Data Engineering program by Grupo Boticário in partnership with Koru. Concurrently, I develop personal projects in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.

Areas of Interest
I have a strong interest in data science and analytics, artificial intelligence, observational cosmology, and quantum computing. I also explore interdisciplinary topics such as neurodivergence, decolonial astronomy, and the journeys of Black and Indigenous women in science. I believe the intersection of these fields fosters a more critical, inclusive, and transformative approach to science.
